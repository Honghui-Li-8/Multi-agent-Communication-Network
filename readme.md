# Project: Lightweight and Efficient Multi-agent Communication Network in Agricultural Applications


# Background

In the context of automation and real-time coordination in modern agricultural operations, establishing a
robust and reliable communication network among various agents such as robots and IoT sensors is
vital. However, the challenge lies in developing a system that is not only efficient and reliable but also
lightweight and suited to the limited processing power of embedded devices typically used in
agricultural applications. A communication network that meets these criteria can significantly enhance
the coordination and efficiency of agricultural operations, leading to optimized resource use and timely
decision-making.

# Description

This project focuses on developing a scalable and efficient communication framework (for example,
based on MQTT). This network will be designed to facilitate real-time data exchange and coordination
among multiple agents in agricultural settings, considering the constraints of embedded systems in
terms of processing power and resource availability.
